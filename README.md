# Stat-Project
 
 We both have two data sets of year-year data on the national and american leagues in the MLB
 
 We'll look at trends over the periods and see how different rule changes affected the game

 We'll compare offensive numbers across the american and national leagues because the american league uses a DH and the national league bats the pitcher.
 Comparing these datasets will allow us to see the impact of having a DH.
