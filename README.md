# Stat-Project
 
We'll use data from the VHSL state meet over 5 years to see how temperature affects the finish times

## Note
We started making this in jupyter, but some pandas indexing brought the web console to its knees, so we switched to just .py files. All the code is in file.py, not the jupyter one
